# Defender TD5 fuel pipeclip
This a double fuel pipe clip for TD5 land rover defender, to hold fuel hoses to the chassis. I tried to have great fidelity from the dimensions of the original part, only the part that fits into the hole is customised. As this model is entirely parametric, these dimensions can easily be changed in the spreadsheet inside the FreeCAD file.

## Notes
I chose 90° of bed temperature and 250° for extruder. I print on painter tape to remove easily.
Slicing was made with PrusaSlicer 2.5.0, i changed perimeter to classical because it was asymetric and not sturdy with "Arachne", and i select "everywhere" for supports.
The print direction is from the side, and since then supports are needed for the "clip" part.
I think it's really important to use PETG over PLA, a Defender leaking oil, fuel and grease, sprayed with water and mud, may shorten PLA lifetime to unacceptable levels.
